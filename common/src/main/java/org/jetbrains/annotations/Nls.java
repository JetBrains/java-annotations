/**
 * Specifies that an element of the program is an user-visible string which needs to be localized.
 * This annotation is intended to be used by localization tools for
 * detecting strings which should be reported as requiring localization.
 *
 * <p>
 * This annotation also could be used as a meta-annotation, to define derived annotations for convenience.
 * E.g. the following annotation could be defined to annotate the strings that represent dialog titles:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Nls(capitalization = Capitalization.Title)
 * &#64;interface DialogTitle {}
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Note that using the derived annotation as meta-annotation is not supported.
 * Meta-annotation works only one level deep.
