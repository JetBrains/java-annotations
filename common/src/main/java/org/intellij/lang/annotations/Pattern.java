/**
 * Specifies that an element of the program represents a string that must completely match given regular expression.
 * Code editors may use this annotation to report errors if the literals that assigned to the annotated variables,
 * passed as arguments to the annotated parameters, or returned from the annotated methods, do not match the supplied
 * pattern.
 * <p>
 * This annotation also could be used as a meta-annotation, to define other annotations for convenience.
 * E.g. the following annotation could be defined to annotate the strings that represent UUIDs:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Pattern("[\\dA-Fa-f]{8}-[\\dA-Fa-f]{4}-[\\dA-Fa-f]{4}-[\\dA-Fa-f]{4}-[\\dA-Fa-f]{12}")
 * &#64;interface UUID {}
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Note that using the derived annotation as meta-annotation is not supported.
 * Meta-annotation works only one level deep.
